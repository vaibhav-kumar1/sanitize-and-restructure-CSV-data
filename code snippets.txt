1.>    Summery of .py file 


Here Python script reads data from a CSV file containing URLs and descriptions. It then processes this data to extract base URLs, groups descriptions by base URL, and converts the grouped data into a JSON format.

Here's a simple summary of what the code does:

1. **Import Libraries**: The script imports two Python libraries: pandas for data manipulation and json for working with JSON data.

2. **Read CSV File**: It reads data from a CSV file named 'Hyscaler.csv' into a pandas DataFrame.

3. **Extract Base URLs**: It extracts the base URLs from the 'URL' column using a regular expression and creates a new column named 'Base_URL' in the DataFrame.

4. **Group Descriptions**: It groups the descriptions by base URL and aggregates them into lists.

5. **Convert to JSON Format**: It converts the grouped data into a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a URL along with its descriptions. The descriptions are assigned keys like 'desc1', 'desc2', etc., to differentiate them.

6. **Write to JSON File**: It writes the resulting list of dictionaries to a JSON file named 'output.json' with an indentation of 2 spaces.

7. **Print Success Message**: It prints a success message indicating that the JSON file has been created.

Overall, the script processes CSV data, organizes it into a structured JSON format, and saves it to a file for further use or analysis.





2.>   Summery of index.html file 


This HTML file provides a simple interface to upload a CSV file containing data in the format described earlier. Upon selecting a file and clicking the "Convert" button, it reads the CSV data, parses it, and displays it in a table with the specified headers.

Here's a summary of the code:

1. **File Input and Convert Button**: 
   - The HTML contains an input element of type file (`<input type="file" id="csvFile" accept=".csv" />`) to allow users to choose a CSV file from their device.
   - It also includes a button (`<button onclick="convertCSV()">Convert</button>`) that triggers the conversion process when clicked.

2. **Table Structure**: 
   - The HTML defines a table (`<table id="dataTable">`) with headers for each column: URL, Overview, Campus, Courses, Scholarships, Admission, Placements, and Results.

3. **JavaScript Function `convertCSV()`**: 
   - This function is called when the "Convert" button is clicked.
   - It reads the selected CSV file using the `FileReader` API.
   - Upon reading the file successfully, it splits the CSV content into rows and processes each row.
   - For each row, it splits the row into columns and extracts the URL and remaining data.
   - It then iterates through predefined keywords (Overview, Campus, Courses, etc.) to find corresponding data in the row.
   - If a keyword is found in the row data, it adds the corresponding value to the respective cell in the table.
   - Finally, it appends a new row to the table and populates it with the extracted data.

This HTML file provides a basic interface for displaying CSV data in a structured format, categorized according to specified keywords. It allows users to visualize and analyze CSV data conveniently within a web browser.


3.>   Here's a combined blueprint outlining the working steps of all the provided code snippets:

(1)HTML, CSS, JavaScript (CSV Data Display):

.Provides a user interface with an input field to upload a CSV file.
.Reads the CSV file using JavaScript's FileReader API.
.Parses the CSV data and populates a table with headers: URL, Overview, Campus, Courses, Scholarships, Admission, Placements, and Results.
.Displays the data in the table, categorized according to specified keywords.
.HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JSON Data Display):

(2)Provides a user interface with an input field to upload a JSON file.
.Reads the JSON file using JavaScript's FileReader API.
.Parses the JSON data into an array of objects.
.Extracts URL and other data from each object and populates a table similar to CSV Data Display, categorizing data according to specified keywords.

(3)Python Script:

.Reads data from a CSV file containing URLs and descriptions.
.Extracts base URLs from the URLs column.
.Groups descriptions by base URL and aggregates them into lists.
.Converts the grouped data into a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a URL along with its descriptions.
.Writes the resulting JSON data to a JSON file.
.Working together, these components provide a comprehensive solution for processing CSV and JSON data, restructuring it based on predefined criteria, and .displaying it in a user-friendly format for analysis and visualization.
